This project is a simple game of TicTacToe to put what I learned in HTML, CSS and javascript into action.

## about Tic Tac Toe

Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

In this implementation of the game the player can chose the boards all the way from 3x3 to 9x9.
